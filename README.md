- Gini coefficient analysis of scoring distribution
- Outlier season detection using Z-scores
- Multiple regression modeling to predict
- ANOVA tests comparing guards, forwards, and centers
- Logistic regression predicting MVP finalists based on per-game stats

**Files Included:**
- NBA Player Statistics Analysis.pdf` — Full report with graphs, interpretation, and results  
- NBA Player Analysis.R Notebook — Source code for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization

##  Dataset Information
All projects use a comprehensive datasets sourced from Kaggle. Data preprocessing involved:
- Filtering players with insufficient game participation
- Excluding outlier seasons like 2020 (COVID-19 disruption)
- Grouping players by position (guard, forward, center)
